## The Odin Project - Rock, Paper, Scissors

Implementation of a simple game of rock, paper and scissors made for The Odin Project - [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).<br>
This exercise uses only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>

### This repository has two JS files:

- _script.js_: the first stage of the project and first version of the game. In this stage the game is only played via console commands.
- _app.js_: the second and final stage of the project. The interface was added and the code has been tweaked to work better with the DOM. Every step of the game is also being displayed on the console.

**The benefits I got from this project:**

- Improved knowledge of functions and how they interact.
- Learned how to stylize the console log text by changing their colors.
- Deepened knowledge of DOM manipulation.
- Practiced the use of git branches.
