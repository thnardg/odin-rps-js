## The Odin Project - Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

Implementation of a simple game of rock, paper and scissors made for The Odin Project - [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors).
This project uses only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
